The goal of moorelabr is to create useful functions for members of the Moore Lab. Currently this focuses on functions for interacting with BreedBase but the scope is intended to be extended to be more broadly useful to researchers within the lab.

## Installation

You can install the development version of moorelabr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("icarda-git/QBMS")
devtools::install_github("rvcrawford/moorelabr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(moorelabr)
## basic example code
```

A number of ```moorelabr``` functions are built upon ```QBMS```, which queries BreedBase.

Package development is anticipated to follow steps outlined at https://kbroman.org/AdvData/18_rpack_demo.html
